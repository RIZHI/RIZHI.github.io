      <description>If you are reading this Thank you for reaching out to this post as it&amp;rsquo;s my first blog. I have seen my fellow peers get into the software industry on the ambition of earning money and money only. Yes money plays a vital role in our life but it has a lot of trade off too. I was lucky enough to work with brilliant minds in my little software journey who loved what they did but most importantly they knew why they did it and that has set them apart from the mediocre developer crowd.</description>
